A RED, RED ROSE
O my Luve's like a red, red rose
That's newly spring in June:
O my Luve's like the melodies
That's sweetly played tune.
As fair art thou, my bonnie lass.
So deep in luve am I:
And I will luve thee still, my dear,
Till the seas gang dry.
Till the seas gang dry, my dear,
And the rocks melt within sun;
O I will luve thee still, my dear,
While the sands o'life shall run.
And fare thee week, my luve!
And fare thee awhile!
And I will come again, my Luve,
It was ten thousand mile.
