Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson went camping in a mountainous area. They were lying in the open air under the stars. Sherlock Holmes looked up at the stars and whispered, &quot;Watson, when you look at that beautiful sky, what do you think of?&quot; Watson replied, &quot;I think of how short life is and how long the universe has lasted.&quot; &quot;No, no, Watson!&quot; Holmes said. &quot;What do you really think of?&quot; Watson tried again. &quot;I think of how small I am and how vast the sky is.&quot; &quot;Try again, Watson!&quot; said Holmes. Watson tried a third time. &quot;I think of how cold the universe is and how warm people can be in their beds.&quot; Holmes said, &quot;Watson, you fool! You should be thinking that someone has stolen our tent!&quot;
