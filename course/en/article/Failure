We learn wisdom from failure much more than from success. We often discover what will do, by finding out what will not do; and probably he who never make a mistake never make a discovery.
As a rule, he -or she- who has the most information will have the greatest success in life.
It is a mistake to suppose that men succeed through success; they much oftener succeed through failures. Precept, study, advice, and example could never have taught them so well as failure has done.
A loving heart is the truest wisdom.
Wise men are instructed by reason; men of less understanding, by experience; the most ignorant, by necessity; the beasts, by nature.
A wise man is superior to any insults which can be put upon him, and the best reply to unseemly behavior is patience and moderation.
Love is the wisdom of the fool and the folly of the wise.
To be wise and love exceeds man's might.
A prudent question is one half of wisdom.
