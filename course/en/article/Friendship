Without friends no one would choose to live, though he had all other goods.
Character is like a tree and reputation like its shadow. The shadow is what we think of it; the tree is the real thing: I desire so to conduct the affairs of this administration that if at the end, when I come to lay down the reins of power, I have lost every other friend on earth, I shall at least have one friend left, and that friend shall be down inside me.
Nothing so fortifies a friendship as a belief on the part of one friend that he is superior to the other.
Friendship is constant in all other things, Save in the office and affairs of love.
Friendship should be more than biting time can sever.
Friendship doubles our joy and divides our grief.
