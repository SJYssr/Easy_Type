Friendship is precious, not only in the shade, but in the sunshine of life; and thanks to a benevolent arrangement of things, the greater part of life is sunshine.
An ounce of blood is worth more than a pound of friendship.
How rare and wonderful is that flash of a moment when we realize we have discovered a friend.
For to fear death, my friends, is only to think ourselves wise without really being wise, for it is to think that we know what we do not know. For no one knows whether death may not be the greatest good that can happen to man. But men fear it as if they knew quite well that it was the greatest of evils.
Nothing makes the earth seem so spacious as to have friends at a distance; they make the latitudes and longitudes.
