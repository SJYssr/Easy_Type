Hurt all over
A young woman went to her doctor complaining of pain.
&quot;Where are you hurting?&quot; asked the doctor.
&quot;You have to help me, I hurt all over&quot;, said the woman.
&quot;What do you mean, all over?&quot; asked the doctor, &quot;be a little more specific.&quot;
The woman touched her right knee with her index finger and yelled, &quot;Own, that hurts.&quot; Then she touched her left cheek and again yelled, &quot;Ouch! That hurts, too.&quot; Then she touched her right earlobe, &quot;Own, even THAT hurts&quot;, she cried.
The doctor checked her thoughtfully for a moment and told her his diagnosis, &quot;You have a broken finger.&quot;
