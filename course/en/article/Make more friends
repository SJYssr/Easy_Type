You can make more friends in two months by becoming really interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.
Silence is the true friend that never betrays.
True friendship is like sound health; the value of it is seldom known until it be lost.
Friendship often ends in love; but love in friendship - never.
Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art...it has no survival value; rather, it is one of those things that give value to survival.
No person is your friend who demands your silence, or denies your right to grow.
The only service a friend can really render is to keep your courage by holding up to you a mirror in which you can see a noble image of yourself.
