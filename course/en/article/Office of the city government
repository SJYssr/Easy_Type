Dear Lilei,
Congratulations! We are pleased to tell you that you have won the high school speaking competition about new Tangshan. Your speech was heard by a group of five judges, all of whom agreed that it was the best one this year. Your parents and your school should be very proud of you!
Next month the city will open a new park to honour those who died in the terrible disaster. The park will also honour those who helped the survivors. Our office would like to have you speak to the park visitors on July 28 at 11:00 am. As you know, this is the day the quake happened thirty years ago.
We invite you to bring your family and friends on that special day.
Sincerely,
Zhang Sha
