THE SHEPHERDESS
She walks--the lady of my delight--
A shepherdess of sheep.
Her flocks are thoughts.
She keep them white;
She guards them from the steep.
She feeds them on the fragrant height
And folds them in for sleep.
She roams maternal hills and bright,
Dark valleys safe and deep.
Into that tender breast at night
The chaste stars may peep.
She walks--the lady of my delight--
A shepherdess of sheep.
She holds her little thoughts in sight,
Though gay they run and leap.
She is so circumspect and right;
She has her soul to keep.
She walks--the lady of my delight--
A shepherdess of sheep.
