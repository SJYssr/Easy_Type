THE SOUL
My soul's the sky--my flying soul!
The light night flare the thunder roll,
The sun and moon and stars go by,
And great winds sweep my soul the sky!
My brooding soul--my soul's the sea!
The snaky weed and whishing screen,
The white wave's surge from pole to pole,
And still green depth--the sea's my soul!
My soul's the Spring--my love soul!
Will dance and leap and drain the bowl
Of love and longing twine and cling
To all the world--my soul's the Spring!
My fevered soul! My soul's the Town!
The flaring street goes up and down;
The bells of feast and traffic toll
And maze their music in my soul.
My tranquil soul! My soul too wide
For sky or Spring, or Tide!
Thou traveler to outer strand
Of Home Serene--my soul so grand!
