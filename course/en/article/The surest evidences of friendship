One of the surest evidences of friendship that one individual can display to another is telling him gently of a fault. If any other can excel it, it is listening to such a disclosure with gratitude, and amending the error.
If I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend, I hope I should have the guts to betray my country.
A friend is one who knows all about you and likes you anyway.
It is not so much our friends' help that helps us as the confident knowledge that they will help us.
A true friend is the greatest of all blessings, and the one that we take the least care of all to acquire.
To fail is a natural consequence of trying; to succeed takes time and prolonged effort in the face of unfriendly odds. To think it will be any other way, no matter what you do, is to invite yourself to be hurt and to limit your enthusiasm for trying again.
