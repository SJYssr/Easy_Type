I see
I quit
Let go
Me too
My god
No way
Come on
Hold on
I agree
Not bad
Not yet
See you
Shut up
So long
Why not
Allow me
Be quiet
Cheer up
Good job
Have fun
How much
I'm full
I'm home
I'm lost
My treat
So do I
This way
After you
Bless you
Follow me
Forget it
Good luck
I decline
I promise
Of course
Slow down
Take care
They hurt
Try again
Watch out
What's up
Be careful
Bottoms up
Don't move
Guess what
I doubt it
I think so
I'm single
Keep it up
Let me see
Never mind
No problem
That's all
Time is up
What's new
Count me on
Don't worry
Feel better
I love you
I'm his fan
Is it yours
That's neat
Are you sure
Do I have to
He is my age
Here you are
No one knows
Take it easy
What a pity
Any thing else
To be careful
Do me a favor
Help yourself
I'm on a diet
Keep in Touch
Time is money
Who's calling
You did right
You set me up
Can I help you
Enjoy yourself
Excuse me, Sir
Give me a hand
How's it going
I have no idea
I just made it
I'll see to it
I'm in a hurry
It's her field
It's up to you
Just wonderful
What about you
You owe me one
You're welcome
Any day will do
Are you kidding
Congratulations
T can't help it
I don't mean it
I'll fix you Up
