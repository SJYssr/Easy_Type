It sounds great
It's a fine day
So far, So good
What time is it
You can make it
Control yourself
He came by train
He is ill in bed
He lacks courage
How's everything
I have no choice
I like ice-cream
I love this game
I'll try my best
I'm On your side
Long time no see
No pain, no gain
Well, it depends
We're all for it
What a good deal
What should I do
You asked for it
You have my word
Believe it or not
Don't count on me
Don't fall for it
Don't let me down
Easy come easy go
I beg your pardon
I beg your pardon
I'll be back soon
I'll check it out
It's a long story
It's Sunday today
Just wait and see
Make up your mind
That's all I need
The view is great
The wall has ears
There comes a bus
What day is today
What do you think
Who told you that
Who's kicking off
Yes, I suppose So
You can't miss it
Any messages for me
Don't be so modest
Don't give me that
He is a smart boy
He is just a child
I can't follow you
I felt sort of ill
I have a good idea
It is growing cool
It seems all right
It's going too far
May I use your pen
She had a bad cold
That's a good idea
The answer is zero
What does she like
As soon as possible
He can hardly speak
He always talks big
He won an election
I am a football fan
If only I could fly
I'll be right there
I'll see you at six
IS it true or false
Just read it for me
Knowledge is power
Move out of my way
Time is running out
We are good friends
What's your trouble
You did fairly well
Clothes make the man
Did you miss the bus
Don't lose your head
He can't take a joke
He owes my uncle $100
How are things going
How are you recently
I know all about it
It really takes time
It's against the law
Love me, love my dog
My mouth is watering
Speak louder, please
This boy has no job
This house is my own
What happened to you
You are just in time
You need to workout
Your hand feels cold
Don't be so childish
Don't trust to chance
Fasten your seat belt
