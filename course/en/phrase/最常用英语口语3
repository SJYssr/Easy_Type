He has a large income
He looks very healthy
He paused for a reply
He repaired his house
He suggested a picnic
Here's a gift for you
How much does it cost
I caught the last bus
I could hardly speak
I'll have to try that
I'm very proud of you
It doesn't make sense
Make yourself at home
My car needs washing
None of your business
Not a sound was heard
That's always the case
The road divides here
Those are watermelons
What a nice day it is
What's wrong with you
You are a chicken
A lovely day, isn't it
He is collecting money
He was born in New York
He was not a bit tired
I will be more careful
I will never forget it
It is Just what I need
It rather surprised me
Just around the comer
Just for entertainment
Let bygones be bygones
Mother doesn't make up
Oh, you are kidding me
She has been to school
Skating is interesting
Supper is ready at six
That's a terrific idea
What horrible weather
Which would you prefer
Does she like ice-cream
First come first served
Great minds think alike
He has a sense of humor
He is acting an old man
He is looking for a job
He doesn't care about me
I develop films myself
I felt no regret for it
I get up at six o'clock
I meet the boss himself
I owe you for my dinner
I really enjoyed myself
I'm fed up with my work
It's no use complaining
She's under the weather
The child sobbed sadly
The rumor had no basis
They praised him highly
Winter is a cold season
You can call me any time
15 divided by3 equals 5
All for one, one for all
East,west, home is best
He grasped both my hands
He is physically mature
I am so sorry about this
I can't afford a new car
I do want to see him now
I have the right to know
I heard some one laughing
I suppose you dance much
I walked across the park
I'll just play it by ear
I'm not sure I can do it
I'm not used to drinking
Is the cut still painful
It's too good to be true
Jean is a blue-eyed girl
Let's not waste our time
May I ask some questions
Money is not everything
Neither of the men spoke
Stop making such a noise
That makes no difference
The price is reasonable
They crowned him king
They're in red and white
We all desire happiness
We just caught the plane
What shall we do tonight
What's your goal in life
When was the house built
Why did you stay at home
Would you like some help
You mustn't aim too high
You're really killing me
You've got a point there
Being criticized is awful
