Did you enter the contest
Do you accept credit cards
Don't cry over spilt milk
Don't let chances pass by
He owned himself defeated
He seems at little nervous
He strolls about the town
Her tooth ached all night
How about a drink tonight
I can do nothing but that
I get hold of you at last
I have a surprise for you
I like all kinds of fruit
I saw it with my own eyes
I will arrange everything
I wish I knew my neighbor
I would like to check out
It has be come much cooler
It's time you went to bed
No spitting on the street
She was totally exhausted
Show your tickets, please
Thank you for your advice
That's the latest fashion
The train arrived on time
There go the house lights
They are paid by the hour
Things are getting better
Wake me up at five thirty
We are all busy with work
Where do you want to meet
You can get what you want
A barking dog doesn't bite
Are you free this Saturday
Be careful not to fall ill
Being a mother is not easy
Brevity is the soul of wit
Cancer is a deadly disease
Did you fight with others
Don't dream away your time
Don't keep me waiting long
He has a remarkable memory
He has completed the task
He has quite a few friends
He is capable of any crime
He walks with a quick pace
He was not a little tired
His looks are always funny
How about going to a movie
I think I've caught a cold
I was taking care of Sally
I wish I lived in NEWYORK
I'm very glad to hear that
I'm your lucky fellow then
It's none of your business
No littering on the campus
She is a good-looking girl
She mended the broken doll
So I just take what I want
Spring is a pretty season
The figure seems all Right
The stars are too far away
The whole world knows that
Tomorrow will be a holiday
We walk on the garden path
What you need is just rest
What's your favorite steps
You'd better let her alone
A lost chance never returns
Don't let this get you down
He shot the lion with a gun
I don't think you are right
I have never seen the movie
I haven't seen you for ages
I was alone, but not lonely
I went there three days ago
It's a friendly competition
It's very thoughtful of you
May I speak to Lora, please
Mr. Wang is fixing his bike
My brother is see king a job
Nancy will retire next year
Neither you nor he is wrong
Opportunity knocks but once
She dressed herself hastily
She hired a car by the hour
Someone is ringing the bell
The Smiths are my neighbors
These shoes don't fit right
This is only the first half
This pen doesn't write well
Would you like a cup of tea
You really look sharp today
Another cat came to my house
Check your answers with mine
Don't keep the truth from me
Everything has its beginning
He came to the point at once
He fell behind with his work
He is the happiest man alive
