He neither smokes nor drinks
He ran his horse up the hill
He reminds me of his brother
He was efficient in his work
He will do anything but work
His father runs a restaurant
I have something to tell you
I smelled a smell of cooking
I want to see the film again
I've got too much work to do
Let's go for a walk, shall we
Please let me check the bill
Plenty of sleep is healthful
The sun comes up in the east
This is because we feel pain
What do you desire me to do
What you said was quite true
You can either stay or leave
Your life is your own affair
All that glitters is not gold
Are you going to have a party
Aren't you concerned about it
Don't forget to keep in touch
He broke his words once again
He is in his everyday clothes
He is taller than I by ahead
He led them down the mountain
He was trained to be a lawyer
I am afraid that l have to go
I don't have any cash with me
I have been putting on weight
I have just finished the book
I was late for work yesterday
It appears to be a true story
I've got to start working out
Japan is to the east of China
John asked Grace to marry him
My watch is faster than yours
New China was founded in 1949
Thanks for your flattering me
They charged the fault on him
This car is in good condition
This work itself is very easy
Truth is the daughter of time
We look forward to your visit
What do you think of this one
What's the weather like to day
A red tie will match that suit
A wet road is usually slippery
Example is better than precept
Go right back to the beginning
He does everything without aim
He is respectful to his elders
He knows English better than I
He resolved to give up smoking
His talk covered many subjects
I fear that he drinks too much
I have my hair cut every month
I want to have a part-time job
I'm sorry to have bothered you
It is not so easy as you think
Keep your temper under control
Lying and stealing are immoral
My efforts resulted in nothing
My false teeth are stuck to it
She is a composer for the harp
Take me to the airport, please
Talking with you is a pleasure
The eggs are sold by the dozen
The price just covers the cost
The sweater is of good quality
The teacher got a little angry
Think carefully before you act
Walt invented the steam engine
We are divided in our opinions
What ever I said, he'd disagree
Who ever comes will be welcomed
You look as if you didn't care
You should look at it yourself
Draw your chair up to the table
He covered himself with a quilt
He found my lecture interesting
He had a good many friends here
He is only about five feet high
Her family are all music lovers
I am busy.How is your business
I don't think much of the movie
I feel like eating an ice-cream
I found him seated on the bench
I gave much time to the old car
I lost the door key about here
I'm not guessing, I really know
It's time to tell her the truth
Let's watch TV with a candle on
Most games cost about that much
My parents want me to go abroad
She has been collecting stamps
There are many stars in the sky
We get to London this afternoon
