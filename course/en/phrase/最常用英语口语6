What about having a pizza first
You'd better look before you leap
You know what I'm talking about
He has been sick for three weeks
He inspected the car for defects
I count you as one of my friends
I go to school by bike every day
I have a large collection of CDs
I won't be able to see him today
I'll call a taxi in case of need
Is there any sugar in the bottle
It's a secret between you and me
It's very kind of you to help me
Let's divide the cake into three
Patience is a mark of confidence
Susan is going to finish college
That is my idea about friendship
The book you ask for is sold out
The boy was too nervous to speak
The play may begin at any moment
The salve will heal slight burns
The sea sparkled in the sunlight
The teacher tested us in English
There is a bridge over the river
They rode their respective bikes
They will arrive in half an hour
Time is more valuable than money
We are all in favor of this plan
We reached London this afternoon
We two finished a bottle of wine
what a lovely little girl she is
Will you pick me up at my place
You may choose whatever you like
You're suffering from an allergy
Beyond all questions you are right
But I plan to weed the yard today
But who will do all the house work
Close the door after you, please
Come to see me whenever you like
Don't pull the chairs about,boys
He drives more carefully than you
He invited me to dinner yesterday
He struck his attacker on the ear
He suddenly appeared in the party
Her handbag goes with her clothes
Here we are. Row M, seats l and 3
His boss might get angry with him
I expect to be there this evening
I really need to lose some weight
I think you have the Wrong number
I would rather stay at home alone
I'd like to look at some sweaters
Its origin is still a mystery now
Money is no more than our servant
Once you begin, you must continue
She is poor but quite respectable
She spent a lot of money on books
The girl in red is his girlfriend
There is a chair below the window
They employed him as a consultant
To be honest with you, I'm twenty
We often call him by his nickname
Will you be free tomorrow evening
Would you like to leave a message
You can never turn the clock back
You may as well tell me the truth
Are your grandparents still living
Can you recognize that woman, Mary
Do you have any suggestions for me
He is tough, but I am even tougher
He made his way through the forest
He suggests you leave here at once
He was married to a friend of mine
He will blame you for carelessness
I can give you a number of excuses
I don't doubt that he will help me
I hope you enjoy your stay with us
I'd like to-repair our differences
It's nothing to be surprised about
It's rude to stare at other people
Bob has always had a crush on Lucy
Let's take a short break for lunch
Linda speaks as if she were a boss
She became more and more beautiful
Suppose it rains,what shall we do
The book is protected by copyright
The ice is hard enough to skate on
The price includes postage charges
This is a little something for you
What he likes best is making jokes
Who but Jack would do such a thing
You should have a mind of your own
You will soon get used to the work
Columbus discovered America in 1492
God helps those who help themselves
He has a nice sum of money put away
He is heavily insured against death
He used to learn everything by rote
He's a terrible man when he's angry
I am on my way to the grocery store
