I am sick of always waiting for you
I appreciate John's helping in time
I bought it the day it was released
I doubted whether the story is true
I learnt that I had passed the test
I will seek from my doctor's advice
Ice cream is popular among children
I'd like to get this film developed
In a word, I am tired of everything
Let us do it by ourselves, will you
May I know the quantity you require
Nobody has ever solved this problem
Our school covers 100 square meters
People enjoyed the stamps very much
The editor over looked a print error
The sudden barking frightened Clara
The teams are coming onto the field
There is a mark of ink on his shirt
There isn't any water in the bottle
This joke has gone a little too far
We arrived in London this afternoon
We can't go out because of the rain
We should make good use of our time
We should save unnecessary expenses
You may have heard of Birth Control
After a pause he continued his story
As you know, I am a very kind person
He dare not tell us his evil conduct
I can express myself in good English
I'll furnish my house with furniture
It seemed as if there was no way out
It's the hottest day I've had so far
Mr. Smith is in charge of this class
Mr. Smith taught English at a school
None of us is afraid of difficulties
Our school is in the east of Beijing
She really wishes her clock had rung
She teaches foreign students Chinese
The question will be settled tonight
The weight is too much for my height
There are mice in Mrs. Lee's kitchen
There is no one but hopes to be rich
There'll be some sport reviews on TV
This company is our regular customer
This is a good example of his poetry
What we read influences our thinking
Words can't express what I felt then
You really have an ear for pop music
A bad workman quarrels with his tools
Can you adapt yourself to the new job
Does the computer ever make a mistake?
Don't be uneasy about the consequence
Even a child can answer this question
He has many strange ideas in his mind
He is commonly supposed to be foolish
He sat with his arms across the chest
He set up a fine example to all of us
His cake is four times as big as mine
I do not care whether it rains or not
I have a lot in common with my sister
I haven't even touched your tooth yet
I'm looking forward to a prompt reply
It is an excellent novel in every way
It is clear that the cat has eaten it
Nothing but death can part the couple
Now she looks pale as if she were ill
She was injured badly in the accident
The secret was spread among the crowd
The two brothers look very much alike
Their interest is listening to others
There was a notice in the supermarket
This one cannot compare with that one
To know everything is to know nothing
To tell the truth, I don't like disco
True and False have opposite meanings
What's the point of going to college
Where can we make the insurance claim
Why don't I pick you up at your house
Why don't you attend an aerobic class
You can kill two birds with one stone
You can't go in no matter who you are
You should learn these words by heart
Could I have those two tickets, please
He has to take care of his sick mother
He hired a workman to repair the fence
I can't make this machine run properly
I don't know if I'll have the patience
I don't like what you are saying
I fell in love with her at first sight
I have just heard from my sister, Mary
If you would only try, you could do it
It is no use learning without thinking
It was a lazy, breezy autumn afternoon
Jack is the strongest boy in the class
Please fetch a chair from another room
The doctor began to operate on the boy
The doctor is taking my blood pressure
The machines will not operate properly
The students declared against cheating
There is hope so long as he is with us
