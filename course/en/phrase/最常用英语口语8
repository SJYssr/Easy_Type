He talks as if he were the head of the office
His cake is three times bigger than mine
I am looking forward to your early reply
I could say nothing but that I was sorry
I don't know how to express my gratitude
I have to catch a plane. Could you hurry
I haven't heard from her for a long time
I would like to wash the clothes for you
Let me see your driver's license, please
She goes to work every day except Sunday
Take a seat please, make yourself at home
The damage was caused by external forces
The doctor advised me to give up smoking
The flowers make the room more beautiful
There is a good restaurant on the street
They covered 120 miles in a single night
Try to look on the bright side of things
What's your plan for the summer vacation
You may pick whichever one you like best
You're welcome to stay with us next time
There was a murder in London yesterday
They stared at the huge tiger with awe
He never misses a chance to see a movie
I cannot put up with my noisy roommates
I will be back by the end of next month
I'm good at freestyle and breast stroke
It was your turn to wash them yesterday
Let's go out to have a dinner, shall we
Please push the ladder against the wall
She is standing in the front of the bus
The doctor asked me to watch what I eat
The grass is moist early in the morning
The test finished. We began our holiday
This question is too complicated for me
Tony speaks English and he plays tennis
What is worth doing is worth doing well
Would you like to go to a party with me
All at once, a rabbit came out of a hole
All characters in the book are imaginary
Do you feel like going to that new disco
Ducks know how to swim when they are born
He spent most of his life gathering money
He usually stays at home with his pet dog
How peaceful and beautiful the country is
I am told that you dance wonderfully well
I have had several conversations with him
It is the best film that I have ever seen
It's only a party in honor of my birthday
Learning English is like building a house
Listening with your heart is good for you
My grandpa died of hunger in the old days
