I've watched all week, but it seems the eagles really haven't returned this year. The heron's nest on the other side of the inlet is deserted, too, though high water and tricky winds make it impossible to get out in the boat most days. Still, it s enough to look up from whatever page I m turning and watch the lake he long trajectory of loons skimming the water, wings beating waves, echoing cries. You know how they always thrill us, especially at night.
