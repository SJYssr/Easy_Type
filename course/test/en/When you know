When you know that you know who you love, you can't deny it.
Or go back, or give up, or pretend that you don't buy it.
When it's clear this time you've found the one, you'll never let him go
Because you know and you know that you know.
When you feel in your skin in your bones and the hollow
Of your heart, there's no way you can wait till tomorrow.
When there isn't any doubt about it once you come this close
Because you know and you know that you know.
You can feel love's around you like the sky 'round blue
This is how love has found you, now you know what to do.
When you know that you know who you need, you can't deny it.
Or go back, or give up, or pretend that you don't buy it.
