Yesterday a man was sucked out of an airplane over the blue tipped mountains of Bolivia. He didn't cry &quot;emergency.&quot; He didn't buzz the stewardess. He just dropped his fork, opened his mouth, and let the wind gather him inch by inch.
The other passengers agreed. This was real life, better than the movie or chicken salad. They leaned out of their seats, envying the man, arms and legs spread like a sheet, discovering raw air and the breath of migrating angels.
